CARS Data Access
===================================================

The `CARS Cloud Data Service <https://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/cloud>`_
provides cloud-based synchronization of data from CARS beamlines.  This
uses the `Nextcloud <https://nextcloud.com/>`_ software suite which works
similarly to Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, etc in that files are
automatically downloaded and synchronized between multiple client
computers.  By running this service on CARS computers, there are no
arbitrary data limits, and remote users can get their data to on to their
local machine as it is being collected at the CARS beamlines.

This documentation is broken into two section.  The first describes how a
user of CARS beamlines can connect and run the Nextcloud client application
on their own computer to have data from CARS automatically sent to their
computer.  The second section describes how CARS staff members can create
an account for a beamline user and select and setup folders to share with
users.
