GSECARS Data Access
===================================================

The `GSECARS Cloud Data Service <https://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/cloud>`_
provides cloud-based synchronization of data from GSECARS beamlines.  This
uses the `Nextcloud <https://nextcloud.com/>`_ software suite which works
similarly to Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, etc in that files are
automatically downloaded and synchronized between multiple sites.  By
running this service on GSECARS computers, there are no data limits, and
remote users can directly access their data on their local machine as it is
being collected at the GSECARS beamlines.

This documentation is broken into two section.  The first describes
how a user of GSECARS beamlines can connect and run the client
application on their own computer to have data from GSECARS
automatically sent to their computer.  The second section describes
how GSECARS staff members can create an account for a beamline user
and select and setup the folder to share with that user.
